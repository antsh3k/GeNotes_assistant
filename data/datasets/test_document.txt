Constitutional (germline) pathogenic variants in these genes are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, as well as other cancers.\nCopy URL\nPrint\nBookmark\nEmail\nPage contents:\nGene function\nGene locus and structure\nPrevalence\nPathogenic variant spectrum\nDisease associations\nGenomic testing\nGenomic counselling\nRisk-reducing strategies\nFamily planning implications\nKey messages\nResources\nGene function\nBReast CAncer gene 1 (\nBRCA1\n) and BReast CAncer gene 1 (\nBRCA2\n) are tumour suppressor genes with a central role in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. HRR is the major pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. This is clinically important, because failure of the pathway means that precision treatment options such as\nPARP inhibitors\nmay be available for patients affected with BRCA-deficient cancers.\nGene locus and structure\nBRCA1\nis located at chromosome 17q21.31 and contains 22 exons, spanning approximately 110kb DNA.\nBRCA2\nis located at chromosome 13q13.1 and contains 27 exons, spanning approximately 84kb DNA.\nBRCA\n1 and\nBRCA2\nboth contain a number of functional domains in which missense variants are more likely to cause disease (for example, the DNA binding/RING binding domains).\nPrevalence\nApproximately 1 in 381 people in the general population have a\nconstitutional (germline) pathogenic variant\nin\nBRCA1\n, and 1 in 277 in\nBRCA2\n. Founder events mean that the frequency of variants in these genes is higher in certain ethnic groups; for example, approximately 1 in 40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry have a variant in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2.\nPathogenic variant spectrum\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nare large genes in which multiple different types of pathogenic variant have been identified.\nThe majority of these variants are individually rare, and several have only been reported in single families (so-called \u2018private\u2019 variants).\nCertain founder variants are present at increased frequency in certain ethnic groups, as outlined below.\nThree founder variants account for greater than 90% of\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nvariants in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage:\nBRCA1\n: c.68_69del (p.Glu23fs) (also known as\nBRCA1\n_185delAG);\nBRCA1\n: c.5266dup (p.Gln1756fs) (also known as\nBRCA1\n_5382insC); and\nBRCA2\n: c.5946del (p.Ser1982fs) (also known as\nBRCA2\n_6174delT).\nA single variant in\nBRCA2\n(\nBRCA2\n: c.771_775del (p.Asn257fs), also known as\nBRCA2\n999del5) is believed to account for approximately 7%\u20138% of\nbreast cancer\nin women of Icelandic ancestry and 40% of breast cancer in men of Icelandic ancestry.\nThere are a number of founder variants in\nBRCA1\nin individuals of Polish descent, of which the three most common are:\nBRCA1\n: c.5266dup (p.Gln1756fs) (also known as\nBRCA1\n_5382insC);\nBRCA1\n: c.181T>G (p.Cys61Gly) (also known as\nBRCA1\n_300T>G); and\nBRCA1\n: c.4035del (p.Glu1346fs) (also known as\nBRCA1\n_4153delA).\nThe pathogenic variant spectra of\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\ninclude the below.\nProtein-truncating variants (that is, nonsense variants, frameshift variants and essential splice site variants).\nMissense variants: while the majority of missense variation in the\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\ngenes is benign, pathogenic missense variants do occur, particularly in functional domains (see above). It is therefore important to consider the location of\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nmissense variants during variant interpretation.\nExon deletions and duplications: up to 20% of pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1,\nand a smaller proportion of variants in\nBRCA2\n, may be large genomic rearrangements, depending on the patient population in question. This is an important consideration in individuals who had uninformative\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ntesting in the 1990s or early 2000s, when testing was limited and dosage analysis to facilitate detection of such variants (for example,\nmultiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)\n) was not routinely available. Repeat testing using updated technology may be warranted in such individuals.\nDisease associations\nHereditary breast and ovarian cancer\nConstitutional (germline) pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nare associated with a high risk of breast,\novarian\n, prostate,\npancreatic\nand other cancers. For estimated lifetime cancer risks, see table 1.\nTable 1: Estimated lifetime cancer risks for those with constitutional (germline) pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2\nCancer type\nPopulation risk\nBRCA1\nrisk\nBRCA2\nrisk\nFemale breast cancer*\n12%\n72% (65\u201379)\n69% (61\u201377)\nOvarian cancer**\n1.6%\n44% (36\u201353)\n17% (11\u201325)\nMale breast cancer*\n0.1%\n0.4% (0.1\u20131.5)\n3.8% (1.9\u20137.7)\nProstate cancer\n12%\n12%\n26.9% (20.5\u201334.7)\nPancreatic cancer\n1%\n2.3%\u20132.9% (1.5\u20134.5)\n2.3%\u20133% (1.3\u20135.4)\n*Note: Risks in transwomen are uncertain. They are likely to be lower than those in women but higher than those in men.\n** including tubal and primary peritoneal cancers.\nApproximately 80% of breast cancers occurring in those with constitutional (germline) pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nare triple-negative (specifically the basal subtype), but breast cancers in those with\nBRCA2\nvariants are more heterogeneous.\nTubo-ovarian cancer occurring in those with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants is typically of the high-grade serous subtype. Most cases of ovarian cancer occur after the age of 40 in those with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nvariants, and after the age of 50 in those with pathogenic\nBRCA2\nvariants.\nProstate cancer in males with\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants is typically more aggressive, occurs at younger-than-expected ages and has higher metastatic potential than prostate cancer in the general population.\nTumours occurring in those with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nmay demonstrate homologous recombination repair deficiency, which is a biomarker of response to PARP inhibition, and may demonstrate characteristic mutation signatures, indicating \u2018BRCAness\u2019. Sporadic cancers occurring by chance in those with such variants may not demonstrate these features.\nOther cancers, including stomach cancer and melanoma, have been reported with increased frequency in those with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\n. Confirmation of such associations and risks of such cancers has yet to be determined.\nRecessive conditions associated with pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2\nIndividuals with pathogenic variants in both copies of their\nBRCA2\ngene (biallelic variants) are affected by a condition known as\nFanconi anaemia\n, a chromosomal fragility syndrome characterised by congenital anomalies of the skeleton, eye or genitourinary system, short stature, progressive bone marrow failure and predisposition to haematological and solid tumours.\nBiallelic pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nare typically embryonically lethal, but survivors have been reported, the majority of whom demonstrate a severe phenotype overlapping with that of Fanconi anaemia and other DNA repair defects as part of a condition now known as\nBRCA1\ndeficiency.\nAffected individuals demonstrate pre- and post-natal growth failure, microcephaly, dysmorphic features and increased predisposition to cancer.\nRarely, individuals may inherit a pathogenic variant in one copy (monoallelic) of\nBRCA1\nas well as a monoallelic pathogenic variant in\nBRCA2\n.\nThis is more common in individuals from populations in which founder variants are common, such as people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Such individuals are known as \u2018double heterozygotes\u2019 or \u2018transheterozygotes\u2019.\nThe phenotype in such individuals is largely indistinguishable from the phenotype in those with only one variant in either\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\n.\nGenomic testing\nConstitutional (germline) testing of\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nis available as part of larger multi-gene panels for individuals affected by breast (\nR208\n), ovarian (\nR207\n), prostate (\nR430\n) or pancreatic cancer (\nR367\n) who meet eligibility criteria as laid out in the\nNational Genomic Test Directory\non the basis of their personal or family history of cancer.\nPatients with breast or prostate cancer not fulfilling eligibility criteria for constitutional (germline) testing of\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvia\nR208\nor\nR430\nindications may be offered testing under\nR444\nif a positive result would render them eligible for NICE-approved PARP inhibitor treatment. For patients with prostate cancer, somatic (tumour) testing should be attempted first.\nSomatic (tumour) testing of\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nis available for patients with prostate cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer to determine eligibility for treatment with PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors are not currently available in the NHS for pancreatic cancer, but somatic (tumour) testing of pancreatic tissue for\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nmay be performed if it will influence clinical trial access. If a variant is identified and constitutional (germline)\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ntesting has not previously been undertaken, site-specific testing on constitutional DNA (usually from blood) is required to determine whether the variant is of somatic or constitutional origin.\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\ntesting is also available for individuals with a suspected diagnosis of Fanconi anaemia under indications\nR359\n(childhood solid tumours),\nR229\n(confirmed Fanconi anaemia or Bloom syndrome),\nR258\n(cytopenia) and\nR236\n(pigmentary skin disorders).\nGenomic counselling\nCancer risk associated with constitutional (germline)\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant\npattern.\nFirst-degree relatives of an individual with a pathogenic variant in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nare at 50% risk of having the familial variant.\nThose with the variant should be referred to clinical genetics services for genomic counselling and cascade screening.\nBecause of the potential for recessive phenotypes in children of two individuals with variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\n, testing of partners or spouses for variants in the same gene should be considered where relationships are consanguineous, or if the partner or spouse is from an ethnic group in which frequency of variants in\nBRCA1\nand/or\nBRCA2\nis high.\nRisk-reducing strategies\nIn addition to the condition-specific information below, please note that patients found to have variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nshould be referred to clinical genetics services to discuss onward management, family planning implications and cascade testing of at-risk relatives.\nBreast cancer\nFemales with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants\nFemales with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants have a number of options for management of their increased breast cancer risk, including the below.\nVery high-risk breast cancer screening\nThis is typically indicated from the age of 30, but may be considered from as young as 25 in patients with an estimated 10-year risk (calculated by\nCanRisk\n) of at least 8%.\nScreening consists of a combination of MRI and/or mammogram depending on age and breast density:\nage 25\u201340: annual MRI;\nage 40\u201350: annual MRI and annual mammogram; and\nage 50 and over: mammogram only.\nRisk-reducing breast surgery\nMany women may choose to undergo risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy, which is usually followed by immediate reconstruction where possible.\nThe residual risk of breast cancer after risk-reducing prophylactic mastectomy is less than 5%.\nThe survival advantage of surgery compared to surveillance is uncertain, but appears to be small, and diminishes rapidly with increasing age.\nContralateral prophylactic mastectomy in a patient who has already been affected by breast cancer may be considered, and, if feasible, may be undertaken at the same time as therapeutic mastectomy.\nContralateral prophylactic surgery will minimise the risk of a second primary breast cancer, but the risk of metastatic recurrence from the first breast cancer should be carefully considered when counselling the patient about the potential advantages of this surgery.\nChemoprophylaxis\nGuidance from NICE\n, updated in 2023, recommends that chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene or anastrozole should be considered in women at increased risk of breast cancer based on their family history, after giving due consideration to potential contraindications and risks of adverse events.\nChemoprophylaxis with such agents may be considered in unaffected people with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA2\n, but the use of such agents in people with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nis less clear, given that the majority of breast cancers in such individuals are not hormone receptor-positive.\nMales with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nBreast cancer screening is not recommended in males with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nvariants, but breast symptom awareness is encouraged.\nTubo-ovarian cancer\nScreening has not, as yet, been found to impact mortality from tubo-ovarian cancer.\nAt present, the only proven method of minimising the risk of tubo-ovarian cancer in women at higher risk is to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Following this surgery, a residual risk of primary peritoneal cancer persists, which is estimated to be less than 4%. Residual risk of primary peritoneal cancer is highest in women who have evidence of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma in the fallopian tubes.\nConsidering that risks of tubo-ovarian cancer before age 35 are low, and the risks associated with premature menopause at that age may outweigh potential benefits, risk-reducing ovarian surgery is not typically undertaken before that age. Considerations should also be given to fertility and family planning.\nIn those with pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nwho undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy is recommended to minimise risks associated with premature menopause, unless the patient has a preceding personal history of oestrogen receptor- or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer.\nMost\nBRCA\n-associated serous gynaecological cancers are believed to start in the fallopian tube. Research is ongoing to determine efficacy and acceptability of a two-staged approach starting with early bilateral salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy.\nPancreatic cancer\nAs screening has not yet been proven to impact mortality from pancreatic cancer, the consensus from the\nUK Cancer Genetics Group\nis that screening for this type of cancer should not be offered outside of research studies.\nPatients should be counselled regarding modifiable risk factors (including smoking) and symptom awareness.\nProstate cancer\nCurrent evidence suggests that prostate-specific antigen-based screening annually, starting from the age of 40, with MRI and biopsy as required, may facilitate early detection of prostate cancer in those with constitutional (germline) pathogenic\nBRCA2\nvariants.\nLonger follow-up is required to determine whether this approach is useful in those with pathogenic\nBRCA1\nvariants.\nFamily planning implications\nThe\nHuman Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\nhas approved the use of\npreimplantation genomic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M)\n(previously known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis) for couples in whom one or both intended parent(s) has a pathogenic variant in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\n. It is best practice that discussions regarding PGT-M and other family planning options be undertaken by a specialist genetic counsellor or clinical geneticist.\nOther options may include prenatal testing (invasive, or\nnon-invasive\nif the intended father has the variant) with termination of affected embryos, adoption, gamete donation, or natural conception and pregnancy with testing of children in adulthood.\nKey messages\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nare tumour suppressor genes. Variants in these genes are associated with a predisposition to multiple different cancers, not only breast and ovarian cancer.\nSome ethnic groups have particular variants in these genes at higher frequencies than the general population, but many variants are individually rare and may only be found in a single family.\nWhen disease associated variants are identified in a patient, they may choose to take risk-reducing measures including screening, surgery or chemoprophylaxis.\nResources\nFor clinicians\nGeneReviews:\nBRCA1-\nand\nBRCA2\n-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\nGov.uk Guidance:\nProtocols for surveillance of women at higher risk of developing breast cancer\nNHS England:\nNational Genomic Test Directory\nNICE:\nFamilial breast cancer: Classification, care and managing breast cancer and related risks in people with a family history of breast cancer\nOMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man):\n# 114480\n,\n# 176807\n,\n# 604370\n,\n# 605724\n,\n# 612555\n,\n# 613347\n,\n# 614320\nand\n# 617883\nUK Cancer Genetics Group:\nLeaflets and guidelines\nUK Cancer Genetics Group:\nVery high risk breast cancer screening\nReferences:\nKuchenbaecker KB, Hopper JL, Barnes DR and others. \u2018\nRisks of breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancer for\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nmutation carriers\n\u2018.

Stage IV or metastatic breast cancer has spread to distant tissues such as the bones, liver and/or lungs; this is treatable but not curable.\nHistological\n75% of invasive breast malignancies originate from the epithelial cells of the milk ducts and are adenocarcinomas (previously described as invasive ductal carcinomas). Most invasive ductal carcinomas have no specific histological characteristics other than invasion through the basement membrane of the breast duct, and are now classified as \u2018no special type\u2019.\nIn total, 10% of invasive breast cancers arise from the milk-producing lobules; these lobular invasive carcinomas have a tendency to spread through the breast in a more diffuse pattern than invasive ductal carcinomas. Some breast tumours show features of both invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, and are described as mixed invasive ductal and lobular tumours.\nA smaller number of primary breast tumours have histological characteristics that permit classification into special types, including:\ntubular carcinomas;\ncribriform carcinomas;\nmucinous carcinomas;\nmedullary carcinomas;\npapillary carcinomas;\nmetaplastic carcinomas;\napocrine carcinomas; and\nadenoid cystic carcinomas.\nInflammatory breast cancer is a clinical diagnosis describing malignancies that present as reddening and swelling of the breast, and typically behave in an aggressive fashion. There are no unique histological identifiers of inflammatory breast cancer, although dermal lymphatic invasion with tumour emboli is generally considered to be a histological hallmark.\nBiological\nModern management of invasive breast cancer is highly dependent on the level of expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) proteins by the malignant cells. Both of these proteins have prognostic and predictive implications, as described below.\nER-positive status generally indicates cancers that have a less aggressive natural history than ER-negative tumours and respond to treatment with hormonal therapies, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors.\nHER2-positive breast cancers are more aggressive than HER2-negative cancers and confer eligibility for treatment with specific anti-HER2 targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab.\nER and HER2 status are initially assessed via immunohistochemical analysis of tumour cells, with \u2018in situ\u2019 hybridisation techniques used to measure HER2 gene expression in cases of equivocal HER2 protein expression. Clinical management pathways divide breast tumours into three groups:\nER-positive or HER2-negative: these are treated with hormonal therapies with or without systemic chemotherapy;\nER-negative or positive and HER2-positive: these are treated with chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapies with or without hormonal therapy, depending on ER status; and\nER-negative or HER2-negative: these tumours are usually also progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and are therefore known as triple-negative tumours. They are associated with high risk of metastases and usually require treatment with chemotherapy. Expression of the PDL-1 protein may confer eligibility for treatment with immunotherapy in the metastatic setting.\nMolecular\nPioneering gene expression analysis of primary breast tumours identified four main subsets of tumours with prognostic implications:\nER-positive luminal-like;\nbasal-like;\nErbB2-positive; and\nnormal-like.\nSubsequent studies have further classified luminal tumours into luminal A and luminal B subclasses, with luminal A tumours carrying a better prognosis than luminal B tumours.\nGene expression analysis is not currently performed as a standard diagnostic test for primary breast tumours; however, it is used as a tool for stratification of interventions in research studies and has also provided the scientific rationale behind commercial\nmolecular profiling tests\nfor ER-positive and HER2-negative breast tumours (for example, Oncotype DX and Prosigna), which can be used to inform individual patient recommendations regarding adjuvant systemic therapies.\nEpidemiology of breast cancer\nThe vast majority of breast cancer cases occur in women, with only 1%\u20132% of cases occurring in men.\nIncidence rates increase in women with age, climbing slowly from age 25 and more steeply from age 35, with almost a quarter of cases diagnosed in women aged 75 years and older. In men, incidence rates are very low in the under 60s and rise from this age.\nBreast cancer associated with an underlying heritable predisposition is more likely to occur at a younger age than sporadic cancer (around 12% of patients diagnosed with breast cancer aged 40 or under have pathogenic variant in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\n).\nAbout 23% of UK breast cancers are attributable to modifiable risk factors, including obesity (post-menopausal breast cancer only), alcohol use, lack of physical activity and exogenous oestrogens (such as contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy). Reproductive factors (such as age at menarche and menopause, having children and breastfeeding) also influence a patient\u2019s risk.\nA small number of invasive breast cancers are caused by previous radiation treatment to the chest region.\nA previous history of \u2018in situ\u2019 breast carcinoma is associated with a two to three times higher risk of breast cancer than the general female population.\nGenetics of breast cancer\nSomatic (tumour) genetics and breast cancer\nMost cases of breast cancer are caused by somatic (tumour) variants acquired during an individual\u2019s lifetime, affecting genes that control cell growth and division or DNA repair mechanisms. Somatic variants are those that have arisen in the tumour, and are not present constitutionally. They are therefore not present in the germline and cannot be passed on to offspring.\nThe most common somatic (tumour) variants found in breast cancers are\nPIK3CA\nvariants, which are present in 25%\u201340% of tumours and may confer eligibility for treatment with the\nPIK3CA\ninhibitor alpelisib in the metastatic setting.\nESR1\nactivating variants are a common cause of acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors and are found in up to one third of cases of ER positive disease that have progressed through first line palliative endocrine therapy.\nESR1\nvariants are subclonal and more frequently found in ctDNA testing than tissue biopsies. Retrospective analyses indicate that patients with\nESR1\nvariants are more sensitive to fulvestrant than aromatase inhibitors. Elacestrant is a novel selective ER degrader therapy that has been licensed as second-line therapy in post-menopausal ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with an activating\nESR1\nvariant.\nVariants in the\nHER2\ngene occurs in approximately 2% of HER2-negative cancers and approximately 10% of trastuzumab\u2010resistant\nHER2\n-amplified breast cancers. Use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and tucatinib in\nHER2\n-mutated breast cancer is currently under investigation.\nBRCA1\nand/or\nBRCA2\nvariants are found in 5%\u20137% of all breast cancers, a significant proportion of which are constitutional (germline) in origin. Certain types of pathogenic variant are not easily detected by tumour testing, and negative somatic (tumour)\nBRCA1\nand/or\nBRCA2\nvariant testing does not replace the need for constitutional testing when clinically appropriate. Clinical studies are underway to determine whether somatic\nBRCA1\nand/or\nBRCA2\nvariants confer clinical benefit from\nPARP inhibitors\nin breast cancer.\nAKT1\nvariants occur in fewer than 5% of breast cancers. Capiversatib is a first-in-class oral AKT inhibitor. Based on the results of the\nCAPItello-291\nphase-three trial, capiversatib has now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, in combination with fulvestrant, for treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with biomarker variants in\nPIK3CA\n,\nAKT1\nor\nPTEN\n.\nConstitutional (germline) genetics and breast cancer\nApproximately 5%\u201310% of breast cancer cases are attributed to monogenic hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, while an additional 20% of breast cancers are considered familial \u2013 with clustering of multiple affected first- and/or second-degree relatives in the absence of obvious underlying genetic risk factors. Many such cases may be explained by oligogenic or polygenic risk factors.\nThe majority of breast cancer-associated, high-risk constitutional (germline) pathogenic variants are in the\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\ngenes, and are associated with a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (65%\u201379% for\nBRCA1\nand 61%\u201377% for\nBRCA2,\ncompared to a 12% risk in the general population) as well as higher lifetime risks of ovarian cancer (36%\u201353% for\nBRCA1\n, 11%\u201325% for\nBRCA2\n).\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nare key mediators of DNA repair by homologous recombination.\nConstitutional (germline) variants in a number of other genes confer a high risk of breast cancer as part of other broader cancer predisposition syndromes, including:\nPALB2\n;\nSTK11\n(\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome\n);\nPTEN\n(\nPTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome\n/Cowden syndrome);\nTP53\n(\nTP53 tumour predisposition syndromes\n, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome); and\nCDH1\n(\nhereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome\n).\nVariants in a number of other breast cancer susceptibility genes including\nCHEK2\n,\nATM\n,\nRAD51C\nand\nRAD51D\nare associated with moderately increased risks of breast cancer, with estimated lifetime risks of two to four times the general population risk. Risks associated with variants in such genes depend on the type of variant (with truncating variants conferring higher risks than missense variants in certain genes), family history and environmental and lifestyle modifiers of disease, as well as other co-inherited genetic modifiers of risk.\nManagement implications of genomic testing\nSomatic (tumour) genomic testing\nThe presence of a\nPIK3CA\nvariant in a tumour sample from a patient with metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer may confer eligibility for treatment with alpelisib.\nIdentification of an activating variant in\nESR1\nby\nctDNA\ntesting in a patient with progressive metastatic ER positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer after at last one year of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and a cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor may permit treatment with elacestrant.\nFull eligibility criteria are provided in the\nCancer Drugs Fund\nlist.\nCurrently, therapies targeted at somatic (tumour) variants in\nBRCA1\n,\nBRCA2\n,\nHER2\nand\nAKT\nare not available within the NHS. However, identification of somatic variants in these genes may facilitate access to novel treatments within clinical trials.\nConstitutional (germline) genomic testing\nIf a constitutional (germline) pathogenic variant in\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\nis identified in an individual with breast cancer, it may have implications for the choice of treatment for their current cancer.\nPatients with a \u2018high risk\u2019 early breast cancer and a constitutional (germline)\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\npathogenic variant may be eligible for adjuvant treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib.\nPatients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and a constitutional (germline)\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\npathogenic variant who have progressed through first-line systemic therapy may be eligible for palliative treatment with the PARP inhibitors talazoparib and/ or olaparib.\nFull eligibility criteria are provided in the\nCancer Drugs Fund\nlist.\nIf a constitutional (germline) variant is identified in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, there are implications for management of the patient\u2019s future cancer risk and that of their relatives.

The majority of affected individuals are asymptomatic.\nThe first presentation of Brugada syndrome is commonly around 40 years of age. It is more prevalent in males of South East Asian ethnicity.\nThe diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) finding is \u2018coved\u2019 ST segment elevation >0.2mV with T wave inversion in at least one right precordial lead (V1\u2013V2) in the second, third or fourth intercostal spaces. This is known as the Brugada type 1 ECG pattern (see figure 1 below). Standard lead positions refer to V1\u2013V2 in the fourth intercostal spaces; high lead positions refer to V1\u2013V2 in the second or third intercostal spaces.\nThe Brugada type 1 ECG pattern may be seen at rest (spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern) or with intercurrent fever or following administration of an intravenous sodium channel blocker such as ajmaline (inducible type 1 Brugada ECG pattern).\nBrugada syndrome is diagnosed in patients with a spontaneous type 1 pattern in the absence of other heart disease, regardless of symptoms. An induced type 1 pattern requires other clinical features, such as documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, arrhythmia syncope or relevant family history, to make the diagnosis.\nFigure 1: ECG demonstrating the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern in standard leads V1 and V2\nGenetics\nThe majority of patients with Brugada syndrome are not found to have a monogenic disease-causing variant. However, up to 20% of affected individuals have a pathogenic variant in the\nSCN5A\ngene, which encodes a subunit of the cardiac sodium channel responsible for regulating rapid sodium current in the heart.\nPathogenic\nSCN5A\nvariants are also associated with long QT syndrome type 3 and\nprogressive cardiac conduction disease\n. Patients may describe some relatives with Brugada syndrome and others with different phenotypes; this would suggest the existence of overlap syndromes (that is, some family members experience different manifestations caused by the same genotype).\nInheritance and genomic counselling\nMost of the pathogenic variants associated with Brugada syndrome are inherited in an\nautosomal dominant\npattern but can also arise\nde novo\n.\u00a0There is variable\npenetrance\n, and although pathogenic variants are inherited equally by men and women, the phenotype appears to affect men more frequently.\nRecent research suggests that variants in genes other than\nSCN5A\nare also important in disease expression, following a polygenic mode of inheritance in some families. However, genomic testing via the\nNational Genomic Test Directory\ndoes not currently support testing any genes other than\nSCN5A\n.\nAll first-degree relatives of an individual with Brugada syndrome should be offered clinical screening in combination with genomic testing where appropriate. It is essential that this is undertaken in a specialist inherited cardiac conditions clinic due to the complexity of the inheritance pattern.\nManagement\nThe mainstay of treatment in Brugada syndrome is careful lifestyle advice.\nCertain drugs may increase the likelihood of arrhythmia in the setting of Brugada syndrome. Patients should be directed to\nBrugadaDrugs.org\nfor the list of drugs to avoid.\nAffected individuals should be given advice regarding prompt treatment of fever with antipyretics (such as paracetamol and ibuprofen) due to increased risk of arrhythmia.\nDuring a diarrhoea and vomiting illness, affected individuals should keep well hydrated using oral rehydration therapy (such as Dioralyte).\nAffected individuals should also be advised to avoid excessive alcohol consumption, cocaine and cannabis use and eating large meals before bed due to increased risk of arrhythmia.\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is recommended in individuals who have survived cardiac arrest or have documented episodes of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia.\nICD implantation should be considered in individuals with a spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern and syncope.\nAsymptomatic affected individuals may undergo electrophysiology studies to assess whether there is inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.\nAffected individuals with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias may be treated using medication (such as quinidine) or with catheter ablation.\nIndividuals with Brugada syndrome should be considered for genomic counselling\u00a0 (see the National Genomic Test Directory for eligibility criteria).\nResources\nFor clinicians\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders:\nBrugada syndrome\nNHS England:\nNational Genomic Test Directory\nReferences:\nZeppenfeld K, Tfelt-Hansen J, de Riva M and others. \u2018\n2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: Developed by the task force for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden death of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) endorsed by the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC)\n\u2018.

Reactions usually occur within the first three months of treatment. The frequency of\nHLA-B*15:02\nis highest in East Asian (6.9%), Oceanian (5.4%) and South and Central Asian (4.6%) populations. However, not all East Asian populations have this allele in such high frequencies.

HRR is the major pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. This is clinically important as failure of this pathway means that precision treatment options may be available for patients affected with HRR-deficient cancers (for example,\nPARP inhibitors\n).\nGene locus and structure\nLocated at chromosome 16q12.2.\nContains 13 exons.\nThe PALB2 protein includes a number of domains, including an amino terminal coiled-coil domain at the N terminus, at which interaction with\nBRCA1\noccurs, and at the C terminus \u2013 a WD40 repeat domain, at which\nBRCA2\nbinding occurs. PALB2 also includes a central chromatin-associated motif.\nPathogenic variant spectrum\nThe population frequency of likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants is estimated to be in the order of 1/770; rarer than those in\nBRCA1\n(1 in 381) or\nBRCA2\n(1 in 277).\nRoutine diagnostic\nconstitutional (germline)\ngenomic testing of\nPALB2\nin patients with cancer has been introduced more recently than testing of\nBRCA1/BRCA2\n, such that data are still being gathered on mutational spectrum and genotype/phenotype correlations (if any).\nOver 900 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nhave been described to date, the overwhelming majority of which are truncating variants (nonsense or frameshift), although pathogenic/likely pathogenic missense variants or large genomic rearrangements have rarely been described.\nA number of recurrent variants have been described, which account for more than half of likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants reported to date:\nPALB2\n: c.509_510delGA (p.Arg170IlefsTer14)\nPALB2\n: c.3113G>A (p.Trp1038Ter)\nPALB2\n: c.1592delT (p.Leu531Cysfs*30)\nPALB2\n: 172_175delTTGT (p.Gln60Argfs*7)\nPALB2\n: c.1240C>T (p.Arg414Ter)\nDisease associations\nHereditary cancer risk\nConstitutional (germline) pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nare associated with a high risk of\nbreast cancer\nand a moderately increased risk of ovarian, pancreatic and possibly other cancers.\nEstimated lifetime cancer risks for carriers of pathogenic constitutional (germline) variants in\nPALB2\ninclude:\nCancer\nPopulation risk (%)\nPALB2\nvariant carrier (%)\nFemale breast cancer*\n12\n44%\u201363%\nMale breast cancer*\n0.1\napproximately 0.2%\u20135%\nPancreatic cancer\n1.5\n1%\u20135%\nOvarian cancer**\n2\n2%\u201310%\nProstate cancer\n12\nUncertain\n*Note: Risks in transwomen are uncertain, but are likely to be lower than those in women but higher than those in men.\n**including tubal and primary peritoneal cancers\nThere is some evidence to suggest enrichment of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer in carriers of\nPALB2\nvariants compared to the general population, but the majority of\nPALB2-\nassociated breast tumours are ER-positive.\nThe risk of second primary breast cancers in carriers of likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nis uncertain, but there is some evidence to suggest it is increased.\nOvarian cancer occurring in carriers of pathogenic\nPALB2\nvariants is typically of the high-grade serous subtype. The vast majority of cases of ovarian cancer occur after the age of 50 in carriers of pathogenic\nPALB2\nvariants, with an estimated risk of less than 1%. before that age.\nTumours occurring in carriers of pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nmay demonstrate homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD). Sporadic cancers occurring by chance (for example, lung or skin cancers) in carriers of such variants may not demonstrate these features.\nRecessive disorders associated with pathogenic variants in PALB2\nIndividuals that carry pathogenic variants in both copies of their\nPALB2\ngene (biallelic variants) are affected by a condition known as\nFanconi anaemia\n, a chromosomal fragility syndrome characterised by congenital abnormalities of the skeleton, eye or genitourinary system, short stature, progressive bone marrow failure and predisposition to haematological and solid tumours.\nGenomic testing\nThe clinical phenotype associated with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nmay be clinically indistinguishable from that associated with likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in\nBRCA1, BRCA2, ATM\nor\nCHEK2\n, such that testing of all genes is typically undertaken simultaneously as part of a small panel, for eligible patients.\nConstitutional (germline) genomic testing of\nPALB2\nis available through the\nNational Genomic Test Directory\nfor individuals affected by breast, ovarian or pancreatic cancer who meet the eligibility criteria.\nPALB2\nis also included in the gene panel test for individuals with confirmed Fanconi anaemia.\nGenomic counselling\nThe cancer risk associated with constitutional (germline)\nPALB2\nvariants is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant\npattern.\nPALB2\n-associated Fanconi anaemia is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive\nmanner.\nFirst-degree relatives of a carrier of a likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant in\nPALB2\nare at 50% risk of carrying the familial variant.\nCarriers should be referred to clinical genetics services for genomic counselling and cascade screening.\nAlthough the risk of cancer in male carriers of\nPALB2\npathogenic/likely pathogenic variants is not markedly increased, cascade testing among male relatives is still encouraged given potential therapeutic implications if they do develop an associated cancer, and considering implications for their progeny, should they be found to be a carrier.\nRisk-reducing strategies\nIn addition to condition-specific information below, referral of affected patients to clinical genetics should be arranged to discuss onward management, family planning implications and cascade testing of at-risk relatives.\nBreast cancer\nFemale carriers\nFemale carriers of pathogenic\nPALB2\nvariants have a number of options for management of their increased breast cancer risk, including:\nVery high risk (VHR) breast cancer screening\nTypically indicated from the age of 30, but may be considered from as young as 25 in patients with an estimated 10-year risk (calculated by CanRisk) of at least 8%.\nScreening consists of a combination of MRI and/or mammogram depending on age and breast density:\nAge 25/30\u201340: annual MRI\nAge 40\u201350: annual MRI and annual mammogram\nAge 50\u201370: annual mammogram\nRisk-reducing breast surgery\nMany women may choose to undergo risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy, which is usually followed by immediate reconstruction where possible.\nThe residual risk of breast cancer after risk-reducing prophylactic mastectomy is less than 5%.\nThe survival advantage of surgery compared to surveillance is uncertain, but appears to be small, and diminishes rapidly with increasing age.\nContralateral prophylactic mastectomy in a patient who has already been affected by breast cancer may be considered, and, if feasible, may be undertaken at the same time as therapeutic mastectomy.\nContralateral prophylactic surgery will minimise the risk of a second primary breast cancer, but the risk of recurrence from the first breast cancer should be carefully considered when counselling the patient about the potential advantages of this surgery.\nChemoprophylaxis:\nGuidance from NICE published in March 2017 recommends that chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene or anastrozole should be considered in women at increased risk of breast cancer based on their family history, after giving due consideration to potential contraindications and risks of adverse events.\nThe role of chemoprophylaxis in prevention of\nPALB2\n-associated breast cancer has not been specifically explored.\nMale carriers\nBreast cancer screening is not recommended in male carriers of pathogenic\nPALB2\nvariants, but breast symptom awareness is encouraged.\nTubo-ovarian cancer\nOvarian cancer screening has not, as yet, been found to impact mortality from the disease.\nAt present, the only proven method of minimising the risk of tubo-ovarian cancer in women at higher risk is to undergo risk-reducing ovarian surgery. Following this surgery, a residual risk of primary peritoneal cancer persists, which is estimated to be less than 4%.\nConsidering that risks before age 50 are extremely low, the risks associated with premature menopause at that age outweigh potential benefit, such that risk-reducing ovarian surgery is not typically undertaken before that age unless there is a strong family history of early-onset ovarian cancer without an alternative aetiology. Considerations should also be given to fertility and family planning.\nIn carriers of pathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nwho undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended to minimise risks associated with premature menopause, unless the patient has a preceding personal history of ER/PR-positive breast cancer.\nPancreatic cancer\nAt the present time, as screening has not yet been proven to impact mortality from pancreatic cancer.\nThe consensus from the UK Cancer Genetics Group is that screening for this type of cancer should not be offered outside of research studies.\nPatients should be counselled regarding modifiable risk factors (including smoking) and symptom awareness.\nProstate cancer\nThe role of prostate cancer screening with PSA and MRI in carriers of\nPALB2\npathogenic/likely pathogenic variants is uncertain.\nMale carriers of such variants should be counselled regarding symptom awareness.\nFamily planning implications\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority have approved the use of pre-implantation genomic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) (previously known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD) for couples where one or both intended parents are carriers of a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in\nPALB2\n. It is best practice that discussions regarding PGT-M and other family planning options be undertaken by a specialist genetic counsellor or clinical geneticist.\nOther options may include prenatal testing (invasive, or non-invasive if the intended father is the carrier) with termination of affected embryos, adoption, gamete donation, or natural conception and pregnancy with testing of children in adulthood.\nKey messages\nPALB2\nis a tumour suppressor gene with a role in the HRR pathway.\nPathogenic variants in\nPALB2\nare associated with high risk of breast cancer and increased risk in other cancers.\nWhen disease associated variants are identified in a patient they may choose to take risk-reducing measures including screening, surgery or chemoprophylaxis.\nPrecision treatment options may be available for patients with cancers that have pathogenic\nPALB2\nResources\nFor clinicians\nNHS England:\nNational Genomic Test Directory\nand eligibility criteria\nNICE:\nFamilial breast cancer guidelines: classification, care and managing breast cancer and related risks in people with a family history of breast cancer\nOMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man):\nOnline catalogue of human genes and genetic disorders\nPublic Health England:\nProtocols for surveillance of women at very high risk of breast cancer\nUK Cancer Genetics Group:\nVery High Risk Breast Screening information\nReferences:\nYang X, Leslie G, Doroszuk A and others. \u2018\nCancer Risks Associated With Germline\nPALB2\nPathogenic Variants: An International Study of 524 Families\n\u2019.

The condition presents in the heterozygous state, where the pathogenic variant is present in only one copy of the gene.\nCopy URL\nPrint\nBookmark\nEmail\nPage contents:\nWhat is an autosomal dominant condition?\nFeatures of an autosomal dominant condition in a family\nClinical examples\nKey messages\nResources\nWhat is an autosomal dominant condition?\nHumans usually have two copies of each autosome, and therefore two copies of each gene. These copies are called alleles and they can be the same or different. With autosomal dominant conditions, features associated with the condition present when one copy of the gene has the pathogenic\nvariant\n, while the other copy is usually unaltered.\nAn affected individual has one non-pathogenic (or \u2018wild type\u2019) allele, and one variant allele (or \u2018mutation\u2019). They have a 1-in-2 (50%) chance of passing on the variant allele, and therefore the condition, to each of their children (see figure 1).\nIt is important to remember that chance has no memory, meaning that the 1-in-2 (50%) chance of inheriting the altered gene for the condition applies to each child, irrespective of whether or not the parents have already had children with, or without, the condition.\nFigure 1: Autosomal dominant inheritance.\nWatch this short animation to see the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in action.\nFeatures of an autosomal dominant condition in a family\nWhen looking at a patient\u2019s family history, the presence of an autosomal dominant condition shows distinctive features, which can be identified by drawing a genetic family history (or pedigree) \u2013 see figure 2.\nThe main features of autosomal dominant inheritance include:\nmales and females are affected in roughly equal proportions;\nindividuals in more than one generation are affected if the condition is inherited. Sometimes, however, the condition can arise for the first time (de novo) in the affected individual; and\naffected males and females are both able to pass the condition to their sons and daughters.\nFigure 2: Autosomal dominant inheritance within a family.\nNote that autosomal dominant pedigree interpretation can be affected by confounding factors such as incomplete\npenetrance\nand the presence of phenocopies.\nIncomplete penetrance occurs when not everyone who has the pathogenic variant manifests disease. An example of this would be hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\nvariants. While the lifetime risk of cancer is increased by having one of these variants, not everyone with a pathogenic\nBRCA\nvariant will develop cancer in their lifetime.\nPresence of phenocopies is where individuals don\u2019t have the pathogenic variant but nevertheless appear to have the condition. Again, a good example would be a pedigree from a family with a pathogenic\nBRCA\nvariant, where an individual who doesn\u2019t have the\nBRCA\nvariant nevertheless develops\nbreast cancer\n(which is, after all, a relatively common condition in the general population).\nClinical examples\nThere are many known autosomal dominant conditions and likely many more not yet described. The table below lists a few of the more common autosomal dominant conditions seen in UK clinics.\nCondition\nGene(s)\nSalient features\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\nPKD1\n,\nPKD2\nFluid-filled cysts develop in the kidneys, with enlargement and progression to renal failure.

The patient supplies a sample, usually saliva, from which their DNA is extracted. The company will then test the DNA and send back a written report of the results. Additionally, the patient may request their raw sequencing data from the company, which can then be sent to a third party company for additional analysis.\nWhat tests are offered by DTC testing companies?\nMost companies offer tests for a combination of the following:\nancestry testing, giving information about a person\u2019s heritage and ethnicity;\ngenetic predisposition to certain disease (most DTC tests look at common variations that may have a slight influence on the risk of common complex conditions);\ncarrier testing for inherited conditions such as\ncystic fibrosis\nand\nsickle cell disease\n;\ncertain variants within known disease-causing genes, such as the familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\n;\ncertain traits such as taste preferences, hair loss and lactose digestion; and\nvariants that might influence drug metabolism (\npharmacogenomics\n).\nWhat are the pitfalls?\nSome DTC tests use arrays (or \u2018chips\u2019) to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs of interest have largely been identified through genome-wide association studies, many of which have been undertaken in white European populations.\nThe majority of these SNPs are individually associated with tiny disease risks, and are best interpreted in the wider context of other genomic, environmental and lifestyle risk factors.\nDisease associations may not necessarily be the same across different ethnicities.\nThe reliability of these SNP chips is very limited for rare variants with a frequency of less than 1 in 50,000 (sensitivity of about 16%).\nDTC carrier testing for high-risk variants associated with inherited conditions is often incomplete, usually only testing for a few common variants, and can be falsely reassuring. For example, some companies offer\nBRCA\ngene testing that only tests for the three variants most common within the Ashkenazi Jewish population, out of thousands of possible variants.\nHigh false positive rates have been reported for variants detected following analysis of raw DTC sequencing data by a third party company. Variants identified in this manner should be validated in a clinical laboratory before any change in management is recommended. Complications arise if the patient does not qualify for NHS-funded genomic testing.\nThe positive identification of a genomic biomarker does not automatically mean that a patient will be eligible for a targeted treatment; access to treatments will depend on the drug licensing approvals and NHS funding agreements.\nThere is a lack of formal genomic counselling around the testing process. This is particularly important for the risk profile reports for conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If an individual is embarking on DTC for a \u2018bit of fun\u2019 and, through the process, is informed of a significantly increased risk of cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, they are likely to be unprepared for this information.\nIncidental or unexpected findings can emerge, such as non-paternity, unexpected half-siblings and carrier status.\nThere are concerns around genomic data privacy.\nHow can I manage a patient with DTC test results?\nIf a particular result is bothering your patient, have a look at the small print. It may be that the \u2018increased risk\u2019 is actually very small in terms of individual relative risk and they can be reassured.\nEncourage your patient to remember that lifestyle factors, such as smoking and diet, outweigh small genomic variants in terms of risk of developing common complex diseases, and that these factors should be their focus.\nIf your patient underwent DTC testing as a route to carrier testing (for example, if they have a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and want to know their\nBRCA\nstatus), do not assume that the testing that has been done is complete or that the results are accurate. No clinical action should be taken based on results from DTC testing. Only results that have been obtained from a formal diagnostic laboratory should be used to determine management or plan preventative strategies. If the patient is eligible for formal NHS testing, they should be referred according to usual guidelines and eligibility, regardless of DTC results. The patient may be ineligible for NHS-funded genomic testing, however, and you may wish to speak to your local clinical genetics service to determine whether a referral is warranted.\nKey messages\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) genomic testing is genomic testing of any type that can be arranged directly by the individual, without being ordered by a clinician or genetic counsellor.\nIn dealing directly with the consumer, DTC testing companies bypass procedures practiced by the NHS to ensure, for example, clinical appropriateness of the test and that patient consent is well informed.\nPitfalls of DTC testing include a lack of formal genomic counselling, a high rate of false positive results for some tests, and the fact that carrier testing for high-risk variants is often incomplete, thereby providing false reassurance.\nNo clinical action should be taken based on results from DTC testing. Only results that have been obtained from a formal diagnostic laboratory should be used to determine management or plan preventative strategies.\nResources\nFor clinicians\nThe Guardian Science Weekly podcast, 11 October 2019:\nThe dangers of DIY genetic testing\n(audio, 28 minutes, 26 seconds)\nThe Royal College of General Practitioners and the British Society for Genetic Medicine:\nGenomic position statement\nReferences:\nBurton A. \u2018\nAre we ready for direct-to-consumer genetic testing?\n\u2018 The Lancet Neurology 2015: volume 14, issue 2, pages 138\u2013139.
