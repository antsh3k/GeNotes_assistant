# Work Packages (WP)

Full details can be [found here](https://github.com/londonaicentre/sde_aic_project_docs/tree/main/commercial/GeNotes_202503_Chatbot)

## WP1: Data Preparation & Infrastructure Setup
1) Obtain and prepare a copy of the GeNotes database for offline use.
2) Set up a secure local environment for data storage and chatbot development.
3) Preprocess and index the dataset to optimize retrieval speed and accuracy.

## WP2: Development of RAG-based Conversational Chatbot
1) Conduct requirements engineering with commissioning stakeholders and end-users (video calls and 1 x design workshop)
2) Implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model for conversational AI.
3) Develop modular system, allowing for interchangeable open-source large language models (LLMs) to be easily integrated or replaced.
4) Integrate the model with the preprocessed GeNotes dataset for offline queries.

## WP3: Deployment and Testing of WebApp
1) Develop a lightweight user interface (UI) for clinicians to interact with the chatbot. This UI will be built in accordance to the colour palette presented by [NHSUK-frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/main).
2) Containerize the web application for flexible deployment in local or cloud environments.
3) Conduct internal testing to verify deployment stability and performance.
4) Collect feedback from external user-facing testing
5) Produce detailed technical architecture, future roadmap, and estimated costings for production implementation
6) Provide documentation and guidelines for deployment and maintenance of MVP.

## Deliverables
The outputs of the work packages are summarized below:
1) **WP1:** Offline-ready GeNotes database copy with preprocessing optimised for retrieval.
2) **WP2:** Modular RAG-based chatbot with support for interchangeable large language models (LLMs) or API connections
3) **WP3:** MVP of an interactive chatbot, fronted by a web UI, for clinicians. This is run off a containerised web application deployable in local or cloud environments, with documentation and deployment guidelines.
